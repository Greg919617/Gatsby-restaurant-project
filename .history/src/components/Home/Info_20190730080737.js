                        There are many various recipes across the Caribbean, but Jamaica is the original home of the Run Punch.  In Jamaica we say “one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong and four of weak” to describe how to make Run Punch.  Remember this for the classic Jamaican Rum Punch recipe. This measure can be cups or gallon, but the ratios must be the same.  Here are 3 simple recipes following the classic recipe of 1-2-3-4 formula of parts sour, sweet, strong and weak.
